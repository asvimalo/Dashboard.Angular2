  <h4>Employee Search</h4>
<!-- The search() method is called via an event binding to the textbox's keystroke event. -->
  <input #searchBox id="search-box" (keyup)="search(searchBox.value)" />

    <li *ngFor="let employee of employees$ | async" >

<!-- The $ is a convention that indicates heroes$ is an Observable,
not an array.
The *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable.
But there's also a pipe character (|) followed by async,
which identifies Angular's AsyncPipe.
The AsyncPipe subscribes to an Observable automatically so you won't
have to do so in the component class. -->
